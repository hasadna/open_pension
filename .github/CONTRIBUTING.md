# Contribution

So, you want to start contribute, Great!

1. First step is to clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/hasadna/open_pension.git`)

2. Take yourself an issue (or talk with a team member to get one). Create a new branch (`git branch -b <number_of_issue>-<optional_text>`), and start working on it.

3. After you do the first commit create a PR (Pull Request) (you can do it from github GUI or Pycharm/Webstorm under _VCS -> Git -> Create Pull Request_) and if you don't finish the PR yet (what I assume is true because it's only the first commit) write `WIP` (stand for "Work In Progress") in the title.
  Example: `WIP: Create Docker image..`
  To link to the issue, in the body of the PR write the issue number.
  Example: `#11`

4. When you finish, remove the `WIP` from the title and assign it to `@nirgn975` or `@ordavidil`, and write some text like "@ordavidil Ready for review" (so GitHub will send a notification to that person when you mention him like that).

5. Please go through (PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code)[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/] and (Angular2 Style Guide)[https://angular.io/styleguide] before submitting a PR.

6. Wait for the code review and HAVE FUN!
